## Overview
* Below is the process I used to analyze a pcap file consisting of network traffic with TrickBot malware
* Trickbot Information:
  - Information stealing and banking malware
  - Distributed through embedded URLs, infectected attachemnts in malspam, or other malware (ie. Emotet malware can distribute TrickBot)
  - Common indicators:
     - HTTPS/SSL/TLS traffic over TCP ports 447 and 449 (unusual)
     - HTTP requests contain png (Windows exe files may masquerade as png)
     - Frame contains “This program cannot be run in DOS mode" (often seen in exe files)
     - HTTP traffic over TCP port 8082 (sends sensitive information from the infected host like passwords to C2 servers)
 

## Analyzing a Trickbot Infection

* File > Open > Navigate to saved PCAP file

<br>

* To filter traffic, type **http.request** in the **Apply a display filter** textbox
  
**BEFORE FILTER**

**AFTER FILTER**

<br> 

* After filtering the traffic, go to **File > Export Objects > HTTP...** to export objects/files from the pcap for analysis

<br> 

* Next, I want to analyze content types, so I sort alphabetically by clicking on **Content Type**

<br> 

* Malware is typically downloaded via attachements. When exporting files, I look for suspicious content types, which usually start with *application/*
* For example, malicious scripts can be embedded in PDF files, so when looking for suspicious content types, I'd look for *application/pdf* and export it for further analysis
* Looking at the alphabetically ordered content type, there are 3 that begin with *application/* that probably require further analysis

<br> 

* Select/highlight the content to download, then **SAVE**

<br>

* On the next screen, choose the location where you would like to save the files, then click **SAVE**

<br> 

* Once saved, we can extract the hashes of the files
* To do this, open up a command terminal window and type in md5sum followed by the file path of the file. Press **ENTER**

* In a web browser,  navigate to VirusTotal.com. Select the SEARCH tab and input the hash value in the search bar

**OR**

* Drag and drop the suspicious file

 * Repeat for each file
 * Results: 
   
    -*application/octet-stream*

* 	Based on VirusTotal, two of the files submitted are considered malicious
    - Application/zip
    - Application/octet-stream
 
* Next, it's time to examine HTTP/HTTPS traffic and look for specific behaviors indicating this is a TrickBot infection
  
* To examine the HTTP/HTTPS requests of the malicious files, navigate to:	**File > Export Objects > HTTP…**
  
  ![image](https://github.com/T-A-Smith/Wireshark-Practice/assets/143060189/de9e3d91-9213-47c0-a9fb-883e56a4a745)

* Sort by content type and select the content that VirusTotal noted as malicious.
* This will highlight the request in the Main window, where you can follow the HTTP stream and examine for signs of infection

*	Close the Export window
*	**Right click the highlighted HTTP request > Follow > HTTP Stream**
